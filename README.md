FAU math thesis
================
# Description
A LaTex template for math students of FAU.
# Authors
Tim Roith
# What does it do?
The provided class and style files set up a convinient environment that 
allows students to create a good looking thesis. The class is designed 
for this specific purpose and follows the doctrine simplicity over 
flexibility.
# What does it not do?
Some of the design decisions greatly decrease the overall flexibility 
of the class. But in the end doesn't every line of code written do so?
As mentioned above, the goal of this project is to provide a easy to use 
template for writing a math thesis that produces solid results. 
Thus we only provide flexibility within the boundary of this task. 
The most important point to note in this context is that we use a
KOMA script as the base class. This is a fundamentally different approach 
than most of the comparable packages took, it is motivated by above mentioned 
doctrine.
# How to use
## Getting the template to your machine and GitHub workflow
If you are not familiar with GitHub or version control systems in general you 
can just click the "Clone or download" button which will create a local copy 
of the files you see here. After this you are good to go and can start working.
I would however really recommend using a repository for your thesis, even if 
this means spending some time on learning how to use GiHub. If you are 
totally new to the world of version control systems this may seem very 
complicated at first, but i can guarentee you it will almost certainly be 
worth it. If you plan to work on coding projects in the future you will 
need to use it anyways so why not start now?
The easiest way to directly obtain an independent repository of your own, 
is to click on "Use this template". This is a great feature of GitHub 
that will set up a repository for you including all the files you see here. 
It is furthermore not directly associated with this repository, hence you do not 
need to worry about changes made to fau-math-thesis. To be precise the last point 
may seem as a disadvantage to most common GitHub users and it is in some sense. 
Nevertheless there will not be any crucial changes to this repository, so you will be 
able to write your thesis without keeping up with the minor changes made here. 
And since getting your thesis done is the main goal here, using the template 
feature will do! 
If you know what you are doing you can of course just fork the repository.
## Working with fau-math-thesis
Theres currently a short documentation in the making. This whole poject 
actually started as a LaTeX tutorial and we will try to provide a similiar 
one in a different repo. Here we use a rather unconventional 
format, which will be a didactic introduction to the class.
